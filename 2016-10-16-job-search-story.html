<h1>The story of my 2016 job search.</h1>

<p>2014: Laid off after 5 years working in C#/Javascript/SQL in Windows for web-based tax software.</p>

<p>2015: One year contract doing Python/SqlAlchemy/MySQL/Pyramid in Linux for REST api server upgrades.</p>

<p>2016: Doing remote contract work for a prior employer. Looking for full-time work.</p>

<p>Today is October 15, 2016. I am still looking for a job.</p>

<p>I have been to probably 8 in-person interviews this year. I have completed maybe a dozen programming assessments. I score 80-100% on all of them, across multiple languages. I (re)launch my programming exercises blog in hopes of avoiding being filtered out by bureaucracy. I move my code to github since people don't know bitbucket. I spend a weekend putting 50 projects from my machine on github.</p>

<p>I get some in-person interviews, but never progress further.</p>

<p>The many reasons I am given, or led to believe:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Overzealous resume stack filtering</p></li>
<li><p>Underqualified...</p></li>
<li><p>Overqualified!</p></li>
<li><p>You said you don't like web development. <br />
(I said I don't do it in my spare time ANYMORE) <br />
(I have since started going it in my spare time AGAIN to avoid this problem) <br />
(Even though I would rather use my spare time on other things)</p></li>
<li><p>We think you will get bored. <br />
(And accidentally invent something they could use?)</p></li>
<li><p>You don't have a strong enough QA background. <br />
(For an Automation Engineering position)</p></li>
<li><p>Not good enough with OLAP style SQL queries. <br />
(But the job will be in OLTP web development using an ORM)</p></li>
<li><p>It seems you cannot comfortably write code. <br />
(On paper, while carrying on a 6 way conversation) <br />
(Even though my blog and github disagree, but they didn't look)</p></li>
<li><p>Too old, too boring, too weird, too casual, too jaded. <br />
(Mostly true, minus the five too's, the benefit of variety)</p></li>
<li><p>Not enthusiastic enough about technology #472. <br />
(Well, I do have other things to invest in emotionally)</p></li>
<li><p>Unwillingness to study trick questions and memorize trivia <br />
(Things I won't be doing in a job, since I do my job well)</p></li>
<li><p>You use Windows? Sorry we use Mac|Linux and we don't believe you have ever used Mac|Linux.</p></li>
<li><p>You don't like laptop ergonomics? You don't use the same carpal tunnel inducing keyboard layout we do? Disqualified.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2>Specific example: DC</h2>

<p>I 100% ace their python hackerrank challenges. I'm pumped. It was hectic, no error messages, no knowledge of the test cases used, and timed.</p>

<p>They seem especially excited about me at this point. I am skeptical of their enthusiasm. I don't understand how it can be genuine, but I go with it. After all, I did score perfectly on one of the harder timed challenges I have taken.</p>

<p>Some days later I have a remote technical interview over video. We use a shared web-based "coding environment". This environment cannot run or interpret the code in any way, it just happens to be a syntax hilighting collaborative online text editor.</p>

<p>They show me some code.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Clean up this code"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ok, it's an html page. It's horribly formatted like most other html I encounter. I ignore the formatting. Why would I change it right now while I am in the middle of an interview trying to fix some REAL problem with this code. And how do I know it wasn't written that way deliberately?</p>

<p>Eventually they tell me to look at a line that "hurts [their] brain".</p>

<pre><code>&lt;head&gt;&lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Wow. Really guys? That's your challenge?</p>

<p>Now they tell me there is no problem with the code, and they actually just wanted me to reformat the html.</p>

<p>They seem rather disappointed in me. I feel the same way, about them. Of course I can format html. I can even write code to do it for me. WooOOooOOooOOooW! Maaaaagic!</p>

<p>Anyway, I format the html manually. Done!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Ok, I think that's all we had, the hiring manager will contact you with next steps."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The next day around lunchtime I receive an email:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Congratulations on joining DC"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh... wait, that's just a system mail telling me someone created a user account for me in their system. Weird. Half an hour later another mail arrives to tell me I was not selected for further consideration. No problem... or so I say.</p>

<h2>Big Problem</h2>

<p>Most of my potential opportunities end in roughly the same way.</p>

<p>I want a job in software. I am pretty much ready for slavery.</p>

<p>What can I do?</p>
