The story of my 2016 job search.
================================

2014: Laid off after 5 years working in C#/Javascript/SQL in Windows for web-based tax software.

2015: One year contract doing Python/SqlAlchemy/MySQL/Pyramid in Linux for REST api server upgrades.

2016: Doing remote contract work for a prior employer. Looking for full-time work.

Today is October 15, 2016. I am still looking for a job.

I have been to probably 8 in-person interviews this year. I have completed maybe a dozen programming assessments. I score 80-100% on all of them, across multiple languages. I (re)launch my programming exercises blog in hopes of avoiding being filtered out by bureaucracy. I move my code to github since people don't know bitbucket. I spend a weekend putting 50 projects from my machine on github.

I get some in-person interviews, but never progress further.

The many reasons I am given, or led to believe:

1. Overzealous resume stack filtering

2. Underqualified...

3. Overqualified!

4. You said you don't like web development.  
(I said I don't do it in my spare time ANYMORE)  
(I have since started going it in my spare time AGAIN to avoid this problem)  
(Even though I would rather use my spare time on other things)

5. We think you will get bored.  
(And accidentally invent something they could use?)

6. You don't have a strong enough QA background.  
(For an Automation Engineering position)

7. Not good enough with OLAP style SQL queries.  
(But the job will be in OLTP web development using an ORM)

8. It seems you cannot comfortably write code.  
(On paper, while carrying on a 6 way conversation)  
(Even though my blog and github disagree, but they didn't look)

9. Too old, too boring, too weird, too casual, too jaded.  
(Mostly true, minus the five too's, the benefit of variety)

10. Not enthusiastic enough about technology #472.  
(Well, I do have other things to invest in emotionally)

11. Unwillingness to study trick questions and memorize trivia  
(Things I won't be doing in a job, since I do my job well)

12. You use Windows? Sorry we use Mac|Linux and we don't believe you have ever used Mac|Linux.

13. You don't like laptop ergonomics? You don't use the same carpal tunnel inducing keyboard layout we do? Disqualified.

Specific example: DC
--------------------

I 100% ace their python hackerrank challenges. I'm pumped. It was hectic, no error messages, no knowledge of the test cases used, and timed.

They seem especially excited about me at this point. I am skeptical of their enthusiasm. I don't understand how it can be genuine, but I go with it. After all, I did score perfectly on one of the harder timed challenges I have taken.

Some days later I have a remote technical interview over video. We use a shared web-based "coding environment". This environment cannot run or interpret the code in any way, it just happens to be a syntax hilighting collaborative online text editor.

They show me some code.

> "Clean up this code"

Ok, it's an html page. It's horribly formatted like most other html I encounter. I ignore the formatting. Why would I change it right now while I am in the middle of an interview trying to fix some REAL problem with this code. And how do I know it wasn't written that way deliberately?

Eventually they tell me to look at a line that "hurts [their] brain".

    <head><meta charset="utf-8">
   
Wow. Really guys? That's your challenge?

Now they tell me there is no problem with the code, and they actually just wanted me to reformat the html.
 
They seem rather disappointed in me. I feel the same way, about them. Of course I can format html. I can even write code to do it for me. WooOOooOOooOOooW! Maaaaagic!

Anyway, I format the html manually. Done!

> "Ok, I think that's all we had, the hiring manager will contact you with next steps."

The next day around lunchtime I receive an email:

> "Congratulations on joining DC"
    
Oh... wait, that's just a system mail telling me someone created a user account for me in their system. Weird. Half an hour later another mail arrives to tell me I was not selected for further consideration. No problem... or so I say.

Big Problem
-----------

Most of my potential opportunities end in roughly the same way.

I want a job in software. I am pretty much ready for slavery.

What can I do?
