<h2 id="How.I.program">How I program</h2>

<p>I hope this will help people better understand my programming style and background.</p>

<p>I learned procedural programming before I learned object-oriented programming.</p>

<p>I wrote <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telix">Telix SALT</a> scripts, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RoboWar">RoboTalk</a> bots and feature patches for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DikuMUD">DikuMUD</a> in C.</p>

<p>Then I learned this new thing called Java at school. I loved it. OO made good sense to me.</p>

<p>I saw OO as a formalization of similar techniques already being used in C.</p>

<p>I also picked up three new languages to fill gaps where Java was not a good fit; Delphi, Python and Lua.</p>

<p>This was around the turn of the century, so I was using Python 1.6 and Lua 4.</p>

<p>Using these other languages I found I was able to be more naturally productive.</p>

<p>I an insistence on thinking from a &lsquo;pure&rsquo; OO perspective was holding me and others back.</p>

<p>So, I started looking for a better path, and that path led me to the old mollyrocket forums.</p>

<p>There I found a group of people who were already well aware of the problem I was experiencing.</p>

<p>Most of these people would become more and more well known for their programming ability.</p>

<p>This is when I started re-learning how to program.</p>

<p>What did I learn?</p>

<p>All of this and more:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://the-witness.net/news/2014/05/witness-wednesday-on-how-to-program/">How to Program</a><br/>
Jonathan Blow&rsquo;s reply in the comments is the highlight:</li>
</ul>


<blockquote><p>The fallacy you are falling into is that it matters how people think about things.</p>

<p>To go to the example in the article, you think about “manager”, “contractor”, “employee” as concrete things too, but that doesn’t mean that some kind of an object hierarchy is the best way to implement them.</p>

<p>The reason object-oriented programming is a seductive idea, and the reason so many believe it, is because “obviously” you can draw these correspondences to categoric distinctions you recognize, so clearly that is how the program “should” be built.</p>

<p>But what we have learned is that no, really, that’s not true. There is a wholly different set of purely-implementation-level concerns that determine how the program should be built. They don’t have a lot to do with what you perceive as different objects. They only have to do with what the code actually needs to do in order to function.</p>

<p>That is what Casey is talking about here: Find out what the code really needs to do in order to function, &ast;then&ast; recognize patterns in that system, &ast;then&ast; build abstractions to simplify those patterns.</p>

<p>This is in contrast to the usual object-oriented way (and many other schools of thought about how to program) in which you a priori decide on abstractions and then fit things into those abstractions. That almost always makes a mess.</p>

<p><strong>What we are saying is that when you first sit down and start typing, you just keep things as simple as you can. Over time you will find patterns. Those patterns may be very different for different programs or systems.</strong></p></blockquote>

</ul>


<blockquote><p>If you’re not used to programming like this, you may think I’m exaggerating, but you’ll just have to trust me, it’s true. I spend exactly zero time thinking about “objects” or what goes where. The fallacy of “object-oriented programming” is exactly that: that code is at all “object-oriented”. It isn’t. Code is procedurally oriented, and the “objects” are simply constructs that arise that allow procedures to be reused. So if you just let that happen instead of trying to force everything to work backwards, programming becomes immensely more pleasant.</p></blockquote>

<p>Oh, and one really mean observation that I&rsquo;m afraid is too true to be omitted: idleness is the source of much trouble. A scientist has his science to worry about so he doesn&rsquo;t have time to complexify the code needlessly. Many programmers have no real substance in their work – the job is trivial – so they have too much time on their hands, which they use to dwell on &ldquo;API design&rdquo; and thus monstrosities are born.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>For ages now, I&rsquo;ve been telling people that the best best code, produced by the most experienced people, tends to look like novice code that happens to work &mdash; no unnecessary abstractions, limited anticipated extensibility points, encapsulation only where it makes sense. &ldquo;Best practices&rdquo;, blindly applied, need to die. The GoF book is a bestiary, not an example of sterling software design. IME, it&rsquo;s much more expensive to deal with unnecessary abstraction than to add abstractions as necessary.</p>

<p>People, think for yourselves! Don&rsquo;t just blindly do what some &ldquo;Effective $Language&rdquo; book tells you to do.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p> Whether addressing programmers or software users, an honest development system simply provides low-level elements and the means to combine them so as to create the higher levels. The low levels come (for programmers, at least) in the form of general-purpose programming languages; and, when practical,
higher levels are available through existing subroutines. Systems that provide only high levels, and claim that it is possible to create any application in this manner, are dishonest: they invariably end up reinstating the low levels in a different, and more complicated, form. These systems are for programming what language machines are for writing: not useful tools, but means of deception and exploitation. Their purpose, we saw, is to induce ignorance and dependence, by consuming our time and preventing us from improving our skills.</p>

<p>Honest systems allow us to create the higher levels on our own, and to select any subroutines we like. With honest systems, therefore, we can choose any combination of low-level elements and built-in operations. Dishonest systems provide an environment with high starting levels, and add the low levels as a special feature. The software charlatans have reversed, in effect, the principles of programming: instead of a simple system based on low levels, where we can create the high levels independently, they give us a complicated environment based on high levels, where the low levels are provided as “enhancements.” What we had all along in any programming language – the low levels – is presented now as a new and powerful feature of their high-level environment. Instead of programming being the standard development method, and the high levels a natural outcome, they make the high levels the standard method, and turn programming into a complicated extension.</p></blockquote>

<p>By now you might be wondering, &ldquo;<em>Does this methodology have a name?</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think so. I keep calling it different things over the years. So do others.</p>

<p>But the thing is, I think it&rsquo;s just regular programming and we forgot that.</p>
