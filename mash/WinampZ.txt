{ WinampZ front end to WinampAPI.ops

  Put all files in the Scripts directory and add WinampZ
  near the top of Bersirc.ops on the 'uses' line, eg:

    uses Extras, Events, Menus, Nickcomp, WinampZ;

  The following are the 'simple' WinampZ commands.
  Try them all with Winamp both closed and open.

    /song, /songa, /rand, /open, /send <nick>
  
  Most commands are provided in a more cryptic z form.
  The following do the same as the simple ones above.
  
    /z,    /za,    /zr,   /zz,   /zs <nick>
  
  There are more z functions, like /zget & whatever is
  added in the future. These are what I use personally.
  The 'simple' wrappers are there for casual users, and
  as a quick way to customize.
    
  Additionally initial support has been added to allow
  people to /ctcp <yournick> !ZGET for song dcc's. This
  behaviour is configurable with WZ_GET* constants below.
  ZGET functionality is disabled by default. /songa & /za
  will enabled ZGET, and /zget toggles it on and off.
  
  Experiment with some WinampAPI.ops procedures directly
  eg. /WA_TrackStopFade, /WA_ToggleAlwaysOnTop, /WA_Restart
  See WinampAPI.txt & WinampAPI.ops for more information

  The power is in WinampAPI.ops, this script is just an
  example using that power. Contributions to this script
  using WinampAPI.ops are welcome.
