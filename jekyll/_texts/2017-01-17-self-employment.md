## Self Employment ##

My name is Mike and I am sometimes self-employed.

In fact, I have many years of experience working as a self-employed software developer.

There are two parts to my self-employment:

1. Product development and licensing, as **Efflare Systems**.
2. Custom software contracting and consulting, as **myself**.

In 2015 I separated these two parts, mostly ending my association with Efflare Systems. 

## Critical Response ##

> _**"But wait, how can that be true!?"**_<br>
> _**"I DEMAND TO SEE YOUR CLIENT LIST SIR!"**_<br>

I have done contract work for dozens of clients.
I have also licensed my software to hundreds of customers.

I will attempt to satisfy your skepticism by providing additional details.

Some details will be left out for legal and professional reasons.

I have split this information into three parts.

1. Contracts
2. Testimonials
3. Licensees

This is the first time much of this information has been released.

Please contact me if you would like to be removed from this document.

## Testimonials ##

### Carey Color Inc. ###
Chad Gray, Senior Developer, [http://www.careyweb.com/](www.careyweb.com)
 
>  
As a long time customer of Efflare's I can vouch for their expertise and customer service. We first purchased ImageCR and gFont back in 2001.
> 
Carey Color Inc. is a prepress house.  We organize and distribute millions of digital images for our clients.  We have written many custom digital asset management web applications for our clients and ImageCR, gFont and ImageFlare are at the heart of nearly each one.
>
I remember the first time I tried ImageCR back in the Cold Fusion 4.5 days. I could not believe Efflare was recommending running the CFX tag without the &lt;cflock&gt; tag.  This was a sign of a well programmed tool.
>
ImageCR, gFont and ImageFlare have proven their worth over an over again with their robust architecture.  They have not missed a beat and I don't have to worry about them, which leaves me more time to program better applications.
>
Efflare as a company has been there every step of the way. Their customer support is top notch and they listen to their customers needs.  I highly recommend Efflare.

### Motorsport Marketing, Inc. ###
Josen Ruiseco, Director of Internet Development, [http://www.GoMotorBids.com](http://www.GoMotorBids.com)

>
GoMotorBids.com is the 4th largest auction website on the Internet,
specializing in all types of Automotive Memorabilia. We post over 1000
new custom images to our website every day. Before we found Efflare, we
had to make multiple sizes of each image, then sort them into different
directories. It was a complete nightmare! 
>
With the help of Efflare's ImageCR3 and ImageFlare products we now
upload one image and we're done. Efflare does all the rest. Their
components are efficient, easy to use, and very fast. Thanks Efflare.
I'm a customer for life!

### World Wide Internet Publishing Ltd. ###
Bethany Smith, Project Manager, [http://www.WWIP.com/](www.WWIP.com)

>
We have relied on Efflare custom tags for years to resize and watermark images.
These tags have dramatically streamlined our web applications.
>
On several occasions we've needed custom development and Efflare has always impressed with their ability to turn out work quickly and deliver exactly what we needed.
>
Without Efflare, we could not provide our customers the solutions we do,
particularly in dynamic image manipulation.
>
We sincerely recommend Efflare!

### Ball Enterprises ###
Anthony Webb, Web Developer

>
I have been using Coldfusion for several years now and have 
tried nearly every image tag out there. One day I came across the
ImageCR tag and decided to try it out. I was absolutely 
blown away at the foresight and thought put into this tag.
I am by no means a wealthy man and don't usually buy custom  tags at all,
but I must say this tag is without a doubt worth every penny! 
>
The staff at Efflare are unbelievably helpful and responsive.
I have never seen such a great team dedicated to making sure you
fully understand the tag and use it to its full potential.
The service and support I got alone justified the purchase of the tag. 
>
Furthermore, ImageCR is being updated and enhanced daily, as Efflare
implements many of the suggestions customers send. Other
tags simply aren't as user friendly, and don't produce near the same
quality in images while still providing the smallest file size possible.
I am an extremely satisfied customer and would strongly recommend ImageCR
to anyone looking for a solution to their imaging needs.

### Sandtex International Corp. ###
Ruben C, President, [http://www.sandtextusa.com/](http://www.sandtextusa.com/)

>
Mike has excellent communication skills, he will work to figure out exactly what you want. He will then provide it before the agreed upon time. Excellent.
